# AI to Slop Replacer
A silly extension that replaces all textual occurences of 'AI' with 'Slop' on web pages!
To switch the extension on and off, all you need to do is enable/disable it in the plugins bar c:

Official link to firefox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ai-to-slop-replacer/
Official link to chrome extension: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-to-slop-replacer/plooebbolhnbnfofpenhkpfmjdnaiioe

To test/make changes to the plugin, download it, have all the files in a folder and follow the instructions:
* Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing
* Chrome: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked
